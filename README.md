1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

To monitor and assess the bank's lending activities, we created a Loan Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard that tracks:

‚Ä¢	Loan applications, disbursements, and repayments over time
‚Ä¢	Good vs. Bad loan classification and performance
‚Ä¢	Borrower financial health via Interest Rate and Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
‚Ä¢	Regional, demographic, and purpose-driven loan patterns
This enables data-driven lending strategies, improves portfolio risk management, and enhances financial decision-making.
